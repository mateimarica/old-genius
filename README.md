## Why?
Genius's new song page redesign employs a single-column layout. This means you need to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page to view the description, credits, and videoclip, whereas the old song page displays them in the sidebar. 

Genius allows you to switch between the old and new pages. However, this state does not persist; the next page you visit will reset to the redesign. That's what this extension is for.

## Features
- Switching between the old song page and the redesign will persist the state between pages.
- Removes the "go to the old/new song page" buttons.

## Installation
- Chrome/Edge (coming soon)
- Firefox (coming soon)

## Disclaimers
- You have to be signed in to genius.com for this extension to work. Genius doesn't allow access to the old song page to non-signed-in users.
- This extension may stop working at any time if Genius decides to remove the old song page.
- This project is not affiliated with Genius in any way. This is just a fan project.
